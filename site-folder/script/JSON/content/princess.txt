<p style="font-size: 1.1rem">My view of this topic is that the inequality in sport participation is a very glaring issue, in the fact, it can be seen in the population of people who participate in sports worldwide. This issue is as a cause of various barriers such as: gender, culture, tradition and perspective.
With these issues it is hard for most people to break barriers and get known in the sports they play.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1rem">Although these barriers are not the only ones that make a division known, but more often than not these barriers are immured within societal norms which encompasses and enforces them. For example the tradition of gift buying in which a boy is gifted a ball and a girl is given a doll. This makes little decisions in the upbringing of the child unknowingly because society sees girls as dainty and fragile while boys as rough. With this the genders grow up with an unconscious description of what each is meant to do. In most cases girls are not introduced to sports until when they start school and start physical education while boys have been kicking balls long before they start school. All these add to the barriers of demacation between boys and girls.</p>
