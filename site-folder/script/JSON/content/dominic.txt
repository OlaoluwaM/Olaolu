<p>Poverty and inequality affect the participation in sports. The poverty that plagues the society stretches far beyond the boundaries of living standard, it recedes the hopes and dream of children whom dream of making it in the sporting industry. Poverty widens the gap between those who have the dream with the resources and those who have the dream without the resources. Like myself who has access to numerous sporting opportunities is able to live the dream of the child without bridges but with the passion.</p>
<p>Inequality is another sinister barrier, shielding the sporting industry away from the potential up-coming superstars. Discrimination is the most potent of this as it kills the passion of children desirous of a future in sports.</p>
<p>There should be equal rights in the participation of sports.</p>
