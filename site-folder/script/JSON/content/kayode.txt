<p>My view on this question is that it’s a very strong question as there are a lot of people affected by such obstacles. I have noticed that kids who play football for instance on the streets, are normally better than those who have wealthy parents that put them in good football clubs that where they can be scouted.</p>

<p>However the street kids are rarely scouted because their parents don’t have sufficient funds to put their kids in such teams to be able to get scouted. To me this was a very emotional question because there are a lot of kids who are in such circumstances.</p>
