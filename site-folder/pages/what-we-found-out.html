      <h1>Poverty and Gender inequality in sport</h1>
      <p>We discovered from the conversations we made with the female children were that they felt that their fathers
        supported them in participation of sports rather than their mothers. With the difference in interview question
        for children, youth and adult, was that for adults they had a broader view on the situation for they knew more
        about the sport world. It was also clear that fathers tend to support their daughters while also giving them the
        mindset that they can achieve anything they set their mind to. Especially if they want to win races or play ball
        be it basketball and football. While mothers tended to think, their daughters ought to be learning or doing
        something else. While in some cases mothers felt their daughters should not play sports for it was an activity
        meant for men for it required a certain type of roughness that is opposed to the attitude of a woman who is
        supposed to be calm and soft. </p>
      <p>From the interview with the female children, this was something that was picked from their interview. For they
        are still sheltered in their own world in which they think nothing of sport as fun and exciting. This interview
        made it known that they are certain things children are not exposed to about the real world.
        For the interview with the two students who were given a scholarship to Greensprings school Lekki for
        extraordinary performance in sports we were unable to get them to speak about their past and their background
        before getting into Greensprings and how they feel this was probably because they were close in age with us and
        with background difference were unable to open up to us. It could also be because they were shy and not used to
        probing about their experiences. This made it unable for us to get an in depth sight on their feelings and what
        it feels like to be singled out for a talent you possess and to be elevated from your past situation due to
        circumstances.
        answers; the sharing of this interview will create awareness while also opening viewer’s minds to a certain
        angle</p>

      <p>For the interview of adults, who have a wide view of the real world and the world of sports. We got different
        and seeing things differently.</p>

      <p>We used different mediums of carrying information like that of questionnaire and interview in our community and
        we
        conducted interview with people from different cultural group, which gave us an insight to different cultural
        perspective. The exploration of different cultural perspectives made us aware that their views were not very
        different from ours because of the topic, which is sports and recreation. Although it made us, aware of certain
        views which differ from ours because of the influence of background, upbringing and experience. We also learnt
        that experience and background were one of the few things that strongly influence your perspective. In the end,
        all the work informed us about “how poverty and gender inequality affects sports participation”. This immensely
        changed our point of view.</p>
